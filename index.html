# 30x30

30x30 is an initiative to get 30% of worldwide land and sea protected by 2030.

The UK is one of many nations that have pledged to meet the target. Our committment was [announced by Boris Johnson](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-commits-to-protect-30-of-uk-land-in-boost-for-biodiversity) as part of the [Leaders' Pledge for Nature](https://www.leaderspledgefornature.org).

But which land and sea areas should the UK choose to protect to get to the 30% target by 2030?

That's the question the group of people that set up the [30x30 GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/30x30) aim to answer at the [MET Office Climate Data Challenge](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/met-office-climate-data-challenge-tickets-136251966299). 

It isn't a trivial question, and it beings up other questions like:

* What does protection mean anyway? See [IUCN Protected Areas](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about/protected-area-categories) or [on WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_protected_area_categories)
* Should the UK optimise for maximum carbon capture, greatest biodiversity increase, or simply ease of meeting the commitment?
* How would the areas we choose be affected by what we know the climate will be like in future as a result of climate change?

The team aim to:

* Prototype scenarios based on different expertise to highlight the different consequences of different approaches
* Produce a visual summary of the context, and the specific scenarios explored (perhaps a poster?) that could be displayed at [COP26](https://ukcop26.org/)

## Proposed Structure for the Two Days

* Different sub-teams or individuals choose an area of the UK they think would be interesting to protect, and suggest how the protected area might be managed
* They analyse what the impact of the proposed protection and management would be
* Share any code they wish to publically in the [https://github.com/30x30/MET-Office-Climate-Data-Challenge-2021](https://github.com/30x30/MET-Office-Climate-Data-Challenge-2021) GitHub repo
* Produce a picture or short document that could be linked to from the map of the UK

Hopefully, by investigating different locations and different strategies (e.g. tree planting etc), we'll be able to highlight some of the potential consequences of the different choices that can be made.

None of this is fixed, and we can change the plan over the two days, but we thought having a starting point written down publically might be helpful.

If you'd like to see any changes to this page, or correct any typos, just let james.gardner@geovation.uk know.

Hopefully we can leave our ordinary levels of perfection at the door, and try to enter the hackathon spirit of quickly trying things, quickly correcting mistakes, and quickly making valuable connections with one another.

## Background
 
30x30 today isn't so much a formal campaign owned by a single organisation as an idea that lots of organisations stand behind. It started at Greenpeace with the publication of [A Blueprint for Ocean Protection](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/publication/21604/30x30-a-blueprint-for-ocean-protection/) but has taken on a wider significance as land has been included in the target too.

See the [Campaign for Nature 30x30](https://www.campaignfornature.org/news/category/30x30) site or the information on the [Marine Conservation Society](https://marine-conservation.org/30x30/) site.
